The **Lite version** starts at $11/month per user. The **Team version** starts at $1600/year with 1 `admin` role ($800/year) and 2 `developer` roles ($400/year each).
  ![dbv-pricing](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-pricing.webp)
  
- **Bytebase**: Three plans: **Community**, **Pro** and **Enterprise**. The **Community plan** is free, while the **Pro** and **Enterprise** versions are paid starting from $995/year up to 20 users regardless of roles and 5 database instances.
  ![bb-pricing](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-pricing.webp)

### Supported databases

- **DBeaver**: The **Community version** supports over 100 databases with basic features, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. The **Pro version** adds more features and also support for NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis, as well as cloud databases like Redshift and BigQuery.

- **Bytebase**: The **Community plan** supports more than 20 databases with full features, covering both SQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, and NoSQL databases including MongoDB, Redshift, and Redis.

### Query

- **DBeaver**: You can query a table either by double-clicking on it or by manually writing SQL with templates. The GUI offers a wide range of detailed features even with toolbar customization.
  ![dbv-data-query](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-data-query.webp)

  You may save your scripts. With the **Team version**, you can also share the script with your team.
  ![dbv-sheets](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-sheets.webp)

- **Bytebase**: **SQL Editor** is used to execute queries. You can query a table either by double-clicking on a table or by manually writing SQL with the help of auto-completion. Although the GUI is slightly simpler compared to DBeaver, it suffices for everyday use.
  ![bb-data-query](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-data-query.webp)
  
  You may save your scripts or star specific saved scripts for easy access. Starting with the **Pro plan**, you may also share the script with your team.
  ![bb-sheets](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-sheets.webp)
  
### Change

- **DBeaver**: After querying a table, you can edit the data directly in the table view, or you can write SQL script manually and execute.
  ![dbv-edit-cell-dbclick](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-edit-cell-dbclick.webp)

  The changes will be recorded in the **transaction log**.
   ![dbv-change-history](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-change-history.webp)

- **Bytebase**: Every change to the database should proceed through an issue. The issue will automatically bring you **SQL Review**, **Custom Approval Flow** and other related features.
  ![bb-issue](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-issue-waiting.webp)

  Every change will be recorded in the **Change History**. Bytebase will also detect the schema changes made by other tools and mark them as **Schema Drift**.
  ![bb-history](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-history.webp)
  
  If you write a SQL script such `ALTER TABLE` in **SQL Editor**, you'll either create a new issue or switch to **Admin mode** (similar to SSH in the terminal).
  ![bb-force-issue](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-force-issue.webp)
  ![bb-force-issue-preview](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-force-issue-preview.webp)

  The suggested way is to choose databases in Bytebase console and with the help of **Schema Editor**, you can create a new issue with ease.

  ![bb-schema-editor](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-schema-editor.webp)

### Access Control

- **DBeaver**: With **Team version**, you may purchase different roles for your team members. Prices for different roles vary, e.g. `Admin` costs $800/year, `Developer` $400/year, `Manager` $200/year and etc.

  `Admins` can configure projects with respective connections and scripts, while `Developers` can only access the projects assigned to them.
  ![dbv-access-control](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-access-control.webp)

- **Bytebase**: Roles are divided into two levels - Workspace and Project. `Workspace Admins`/`DBAs` set up database instances and manage members. `Project Owners` handle databases, issues, and members at the Project level. Individuals can hold multiple project-level roles, such as `Project Developers` (change database), and `Project Queriers` (query database).
  ![bb-access-control](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-access-control.webp)
  
   With **Community plan**, if one's not assigned to a project, one can't see the project at all. With **Enterprise plan**, `Project Owner` can grant access to specific databases or tables instead of all project databases to a specific `Project Querier`. `Project Developer` can also request to query or export a database or table with a request issue.
  ![bb-access-control-adv](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-access-control-adv.webp)

  Additionally, `Admins`/`DBAs` can set different data access controls for various environments, such as restricted access to production data and open access to development data.
  ![bb-ac-env](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-ac-env.webp)

### Data Masking

- **DBeaver**: No data masking for `admin` & `developer` scenario. In `manager` & `viewer`'s case, a `manager` can create data sets and assign them to `viewers` and a `viewer` can only access or export the data sets one's assigned to.
  ![dbv-dataset](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-dataset.webp)

- **Bytebase**: `Admins`/`DBAs`/`Project Owners` can configure data masking for specific columns within a table and can also authorize particular users to access the original, unmasked data. `Project Querier`, on the other hand, is limited to accessing only the masked data.

  Furthermore, `Admins`/`DBAs` can define semantic types for masking algorithms, such as email, phone, credit card, etc. As a result, the data will be masked according to the semantic type configured.
  ![bb-masking-graph](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-masking-graph.webp)

### Compare

- **DBeaver**: Both schema compare and data compare are supported, but limited to two at a time. For the schema compare results, you have the option to export them as DDL scripts or Liquibase Changelogs.
  ![dbv-schema-compare](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-schema-compare.webp)

  For data compare, you can compare two tables and generate a SQL script to synchronize the data between them.
  ![dbv-data-compare](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-data-compare.webp)

- **Bytebase**: Only schema compare is supported, or more precisely it's **Schema Sync**. You can initially select one database and then choose several others for comparison. The result will generate DDLs and create a new issue comprising changes to all selected databases for SQL review, approval and execution.

  ![bb-batch-issue](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/bb-batch-issue.webp)

### Audit log

- **DBeaver**: **Query manager** is available for the **Team version**. It records all SQL related of the team members which can be filtered.
  ![dbv-audit-log](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-dbeaver/dbv-audit-log.webp)

- **Bytebase**: **Audit Log** is available for the **Enterprise plan**. It records all the activities within Bytebase which can be filtered or exported.
